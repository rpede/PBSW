Two types of risks. Product/quality risk and project/planning risk.

ISTQB Risk glossary p 76.

Risk-based testing
==================
Classify the level of risks: Properbility/likelihood of the risk occuring (percent). The impact of a risk being present in the product.

Testing efforts are determined by the level of risk posed by the identified risk items.

Mitigation and contingency actions are determined for each risk item.

Risk management
---------------
1) Risk identification: Identifying different risk items (project & quality).
2) Risk analysis: Assesing the level of risk for each risk item. See ISO 9126.
3) Risk mitigation/risk control: Mitigation contingency transference and acceptance actions for each risk. Implementing protective measures for reducing/managing the risks.

Testing process
===============
The activity of establishing or updating a test plan.
Test plan: scope, resources, schedule. Test items including: who conducts the tests, entry/exit criteria.

- Planning, control
- Analysis, design
- Implementation, execution
- Evaluating exit criteria, reporting
- Test closure activities

Test item design: Preconditions, test environment requirements, test inputs *and other test data requirements), extected results, postconditions.

Test oracle is a source we use to determine the expected results of a test.
